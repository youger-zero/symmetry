Geometry Diagram Parsing and Reasoning Based on Deep Semantic Fusion
Abstract
The central thesis of this paper is that an effective system for Automated Geometric Problem Solving (AGP) must integrate strong visual perception with equally advanced textual comprehension. We propose a dual-stream fusion model that incorporates a Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) into the geometric diagram parsing pipeline. At its core is a Semantic-Guided Cross-Attention (SGCA) mechanism, which leverages the global semantic intent of the problem text to guide attention toward key visual primi-tives. This yields context-enriched visual representations that serve as inputs to a Graph Neural Network (GNN), enabling relational reasoning that is not only percep-tion-driven but also context-aware. By explicitly bridging the semantic gap between text and diagrams, our approach delivers more robust and accurate predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a semantic-guided cross-attention mechanism into geometric diagram parsing, establishing a new para-digm that effectively addresses the cross-modal semantic gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
The datasets used in our study (PGDP5K and IMP-Geometry3K) are available for download.
